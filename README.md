# ESP8266-TempLogger

This Project aims to develop a temperature and humidity sensor with runs on simple batteries and is based on the cheap wifi ÂµController EPS-0x.

Current ToDos:
* Implement better storage system
* Add transmission of sensor ID (maybe MAC address?)
* Add hash of value and shared secret to avoid faked values
* Check if the arduino IDE allows HTTPS and HTTP-Auth with ESPs
* Add [three.js](http://threejs.org/) for visualisation
